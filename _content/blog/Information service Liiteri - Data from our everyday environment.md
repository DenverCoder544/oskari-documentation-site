# Information service Liiteri – Data from our everyday environment

Liiteri is an information service focusing on the living environment and is governed by Finnish Environment Institute. Geographical information and statistics about the built environment and land use planning have been gathered in Liiteri.

## How is Oskari used?

The service includes hundreds of map layers, over a thousand statistics, national land use plans and about 20 000 Forms for monitoring local detailed plans.

Liiteri development started already in 2012 when there was a huge national program for "Enhancing the electronic democracy tools" (SADe). During that program a map service was being developed by the NLS-FI (later known as Oskari).

## Who is the map service for?

Liiteri serves authorities and companies that work in sectors involving land use planning and built environment. Liiteri can for example be used for land use planning processes, granting permissions and subsidies related to construction, formulating strategic plans and programs, supporting statements, and monitoring the state of the built environment.

The service is also useful for students and researchers. Citizens interested in their living environment can search for information about their neighbourhood’s services or the current situation of land use planning.
