The UI has multilingual support and there are already multiple languages translated. All source code is being published with [MIT/EUPL licenses](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-docs/blob/master/documents/LICENSE-MIT.txt).

# How do I create embedded maps from Oskari?

If you donâ€™t want to set up your own Oskari installation, you can build map views with the **Published maps** functionality in Oskari. This requires an Oskari installation that has enabled the Published map functionality.

If you are registered to the Oskari site you want to use, add the map layers you need to the map and click **Published maps**. Follow the instructions. You will get and iframe code that you can embed to your web site.

# Why are there no layers in an embedded map?

Check access rights. It might be that users with guest-role (most of the people looking at embedded maps) don't have permission to see layers included in the embedded map.

# How do I tailor my embedded maps?

Embedded maps can be tweaked to be in contact with your web site and provide more information to users using code snippets called RPC (Remote Process Call). See [the RPC example codes.](https://oskari.org/examples/rpc-api/)
